## [Worldwide Marketplace](#worldwide-marketplace)

The world's economies are tied together more than any time in history. China uses African oil to produce goods for Americans who drive cars built by Germans that share a currency with most of Europe which constantly scouts South America for soccer players. An over-simplification, but it's a simple example of why the world lacks global conflict and war: __mutual dependence__.

Powerful foreign and domestic share-holders help avoid conflict. The domestic partners protect local interests while foreign partners bring in investment and defend its interests on the world stage. It's no coincidence politically and economically isolated countries like North Korea, Iraq, Libya, and Iran are also hotbeds for conflict.

## [The MBA](#the-mba)

For non-isolated economies, the recipe for success is growth via managed risk: the job of __the MBA__ or more generally the owner. As an undergrad at Georgia Tech, management was seen as "below" engineering and science, even coining [M-train](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=M-train) as the easier route of escape, but that's just a false sense of superiority some traditionally "smart" students have. ["Smart" is overrated](/living/smart-is-overrated.html).

Engineering and the sciences lead to safe, comfortable employment, but if you start a company, you'll need an MBA on your side because to succeed in today's connected world you need to speak the language. MBA buzzwords may be [easy fodder for jokes](http://www.kamalgautam.com/Ivey/images/bingo.JPG), but when fostering relationships across countries and cultures, the cliche is inoffensive and gets the point across. __Diversity__ and inclusion are paramount: making everyone feel welcome and wanted is an important ingredient to maintaining growth.

The MBA studies, designs, and manages systems of people and companies like engineers and scientists study fluid dynamics and physics, and while their heavily-controlled systems can be frustrating, the end result is likely a guaranteed, lower-than-deserved paycheck.

## [Systems over Communities](#systems-over-communities)

Though people have been employeed for centuries, the Communication Age empowers owners to impact the daily life of people across the world without direct involvement: they raise money and create rules for businesses that employ people on a large scale. A well-designed system commoditizes its workforce: Walmart, McDonald's, and UPS employ millions, every one replaceable.

Owners and governments use __red tape__ to produce predictable, measurable, systematic results. Everyone has explicit powers to perform a specific job and reports directly to someone else. Both employees and customers are __in the system__:

* Customer Service reps are given scripts to appease customers
* Telemarketers are given quotas for cold calls
* Police officers enforce laws and follow protocols
* Criminals are detained, sentenced, and punished by police officers, judges, and guards
* Students are trained by teachers to pass standardized tests

When in the system, you aren't an individual: you and everyone you interact with are playing well-defined roles. In contract, __a community__ encourages everyone to help one another by making informed decisions revolving around the individual, an impractical approach in the worldwide marketplace where managers, red tape, and statistics will continue to thrive.

## [Services and Ownership](#services-and-ownership)

As people interact more within systems, owners and governments choose to produce services over products. Selling products is a discrete transaction while services generate a __revenue stream__ which are more predictable and systematic: you regularly charge all your customers until they cancel, and good luck canceling.

Services also allow the creator to maintain ownership and control. Every year people click `I Agree` on countless [terms of services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service) which mainly have two goals: __limit company liability and maximize company ownership__:

* [MySpace claimed a transferable, royalty-free license on user-uploaded music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Myspace#Musicians.27_rights_and_Myspace_terms_of_use_agreement)
* [Facebook and Google claimed the right to use your photos in advertisements](http://gigaom.com/2013/10/15/heres-why-its-legal-for-google-and-facebook-to-use-your-face-in-ads/)
* [Twitter claims a broad license on everything you tweet and restricts others from using it without following strict guidelines](https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements)
* [Google Play reserves the right to "remove from your Device or cease providing you with access to certain Products that you have purchased"](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html). Yes "purchased".

All these agreements boil to companies managing risk, and there is an ongoing debate of what [digital rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights) users should not be allowed to give up, but the trend is clear: companies are converting products into services because they are easier to own and control.

## [Controlling Communication](#controlling-communication)

Every new technology you use can also be used against you. The US government monitors domestic and international Internet traffic, and Middle Eastern governments have [shut down their Internet to prevent political activism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring), but there are more subtle instances of controlling communication:

* Professional sports regularly fine players for comments "detrimental to the league".
* [The MPAA is more harsh on homosexual content than hetrosexual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Film_Is_Not_Yet_Rated).
* Lawmakers name bills [appealing names](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act) to get them passed more easily.
* Political causes are ["for something"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-choice) instead of ["against another"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements).
* Advertisements emphasize "saving", not "spending".

__Controlling communication is easy when the audience is lazy, busy, distracted or over-whelmed.__ You just need to carefully craft a consistent message and feed it to those who won't read beyond the headline. Remember this when interacting with strangers: submitting resumes, requesting a discount, designing a webpage, or starting a relationship.

## [Perceived Value](#perceived-value)

By effectively controlling communication, you can get people to do what you want. For companies, that means charging more:

* __Fashion__ decides whether a skirt, purse, or shoes costs $30 or $300.
* __Branding__ doubles the price of cereal.
* __Convience and Comfort__ adds around 10-50%.
* __Cool and fun__ charges anything they want.

Owners are very careful with how people perceive their company and services, and the Communication Age makes it very easy to manipulate: employees rarely speak for the company and the company rarely says anything worth hearing. [Saying the right thing is now just as important as doing the right thing.](http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/06/02/oil.spill.bp.apology/)

## [Abandoning Production](#abandoning-production)

Systems and the worldwide marketplace have turned production into an assembly line, leaving the highest paying jobs far removed from the production/customers:

* Why grow corn if you can manage people who grow corn?
* Why manage people when you can manage departments that manage people?
* Why manage departments when you can manage companies?
* Why manage companies when you can invest in companies?
* Why invest in companies when you can invest other people's money in companies?
* Why invest other people's money in companies when you can manage companies that invest other people's money?
* Why do anything when you can govern how people do everything?

Each step aggregates power and pools risk. While aggregation should minimize overall risk, [the subprime mortage crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble#Subprime_mortgage_industry_collapse) showed it also obscures critical information and __protects the people who only produce words, red tape, and employees__.

## [Wrap-Up](#wrap-up)

Consistent world-wide communication has changed the way we live and has created new positions of power, from software development to corporate executives and from grass-root campaigns to federal agencies. In the right position, one person can directly impact the lives of millions (for better or worse), but there are many ways you can directly improve your life:

* Avoid systems with a negative net impact to your life
* Save money, avoid paralysing loans, and take calculated risks
* Treat everyone as an individual deserving respect
* Research cleverly crafted messages
* Maintain your power when becoming another's method of production
