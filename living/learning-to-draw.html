      <h2 id="why"><a href="#why">Why?</a></h2>
      <p>In a time before smart phones and social media, we were left to ourselves more often. I had a good job as a software developer, but being required to think about software 40hr/wk left me with little desire to focus on it outside of work, so I tried my hand at drawing.</p>
      <p>Why drawing? I'm left-handed, and some theories predict that makes me apt to be <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/a/left-brain-right-brain.htm">right-brained</a> (creative, intuitive, and images over language) and personally I agree. While software may sound right-brained (logic, reason, critical thinking), it's appeal is creative: literally creating something out of nothing. I didn't understand the point until stumbling across <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">Paul Graham's "Hackers and Painters"</a> while in college studing Computer Science. "Hackers" doesn't refer to anything illegal but to tinkerers: people who toy with and create systems, testing their limits, improving them.</p>
      <p>Half-baked psychological theories aside, I enjoy creating. Visual pursuits come easily, while writing is difficult. Drawing felt like the perfect outlet.</p>
      <h2 id="how"><a href="#how">How?</a></h2>
      <p>I remember drawing some (not much) in elementary school, but after that my proficiency at math, science, and sports kept me away from the arts, so how was I supposed to learn how to draw?</p>
      <p>While I didn't possess an innate ability to draw (does anyone?), I have always been able to focus: remove everything but a single purpose from my mind for hours at a time. So after purchasing a pencil, an eraser, a ruler, a sketchpad, and two "learn to draw" books I focused on drawing. The books had several exercises:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Draw without looking down</strong> to help develop the mechanics of drawing without worrying about getting the picture right.</li>
        <li><strong>Draw sections of the subject</strong> to help focus on individual lines instead of the subject as a whole.</li>
        <li><strong>Draw the subject upside-down</strong> to help detach my perception of the subject and focus on individual parts.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="gallery"><a href="#gallery">Gallery</a></h2>
      <p>Over the course of several months (maybe a year, I honestly forget), I would pick a scene from a movie or a picture off the Internet and draw it. I never finished a drawing in one sitting, but would come back to it over the course of a week with a fresh perspective (do the eyes look right?!). My sketchpad slowly filled up. Here are some samples:</p>

      <h2 id="the-point"><a href="#the-point">The Point</a></h2>
      <p>I eventually lost my drive to draw every day which quickly deteriorated into stopping altogether, but looking back I accomplished what I set out to do: <strong>draw something I loved looking at</strong>, which in my early twenties happened to be women. Shocking. I recently bought a new scanner, which (unlike my old one) could adequately digitize my drawings before time faded my old sketchpad.</p>
      <p>Upon seeing the drawings, people's reaction was normally "you're so talented," gifted, lucky, or blessed. Those words are comfort for speaker: turning an earned skill into something God, nature, or chance gave me, so without being an ass, I try and explain that I was initially awful but gradually improved over time, lots of time.</p>
      <p>Time spent in my alone apartment, not showing anything to anyone. In contrast, <a href="the-communication-age.html">The Communication Age</a> tempts you to communicate the every step of development and creation instead of truly focusing on becoming better.</p>
