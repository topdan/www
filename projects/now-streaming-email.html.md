## Introduction

When I moved back into Atlanta six years ago, I didn't get cable TV. Not because of any deep philosophical or financial reasons: I was just indifferent about it and curious how far streaming had come. Since then streaming  has exploded into our phones, game consoles, and TVs but it still has a major problem.

## The Problem

__How do I know when new episodes and movies are available without regularly visiting multiple places?__

The solution won't come from one of the service providers. They want their website to be your starting-point so they can push their new content and more easily direct you to mutually beneficial places.

## The Solution

I already check my email regularly, so __I created a bi-weekly email detailing now streaming content online__. It's simple, takes very little time to scroll through, and most importantly I don't need to go anywhere: it comes to me.

Here's what I care about:

* New shows, seasons, episodes, and movies
* Episodes and movies that are expiring soon
* New movie trailers on http://trailers.apple.com

Here's what I don't care about:

* Reality TV
* Soap Operas
* News and talk shows

Here's what it supports:

* Netflix
* Hulu
* Amazon Instant
* Amazon Prime
* CBS.com
* HBOgo
* MAXgo
* Showtime Anywhere
* Redbox Kiosks

New emails arrive every Tuesday and Friday evenings.

## The Implementation

![Sample Email](email-2014-10-14.png)

Here's what I got from this email:

* I watched the "Always Woodstock" trailer
* "The Tomorrow People" is now on Netflix
* A couple female-oriented shows premiered on Hulu
* New season of "Bob's Burgers" and "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" premiered
* "Breathe In" is on Netflix Instant
* "Carrie" remake is on Amazon Prime
* HBOgo is about to remove "Ender's Game"

__All that in about 15 seconds of scrolling.__

## Conclusion

I've been getting these emails for about a year, and it really helps keep me up-to-date on what's new, with minimal effort. The implementation wasn't easy, but the result (while not perfect) is simple.
